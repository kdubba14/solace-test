I structured this in order of the commits for each issues (or set of issues) that I had separated. I hope you enjoy!

I would have loved to add 4 separate features to this if I had more time:

- Finding a better drizzle orm solution for checking the string values of the JSON array
- Virtualization for the list, if it will have hundreds of thousands of records, this will help the DOM not be overloaded
- Error handling, I feel that proper error handling is generally a necessity
- Tests, for backwards compatibility :)

UI:

- View in table header (last name) that shows if its sorting and in what direction

API:

- Sort functionality (last name) within query params
