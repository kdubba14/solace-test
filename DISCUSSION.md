I would have loved to add 3 separate features to this if I had more time:

- Virtualization for the list, if it will have hundreds of thousands of records, this will help the DOM not be overloaded
- Error handling, I feel that proper error handling is generally a necessity
- Tests, for backwards compatibility :)
